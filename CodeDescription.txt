My code is using Trie data structure to store the vocabularies and traverse the Trie tree to accomplish autocomplete.

The TrieNode class contains the following class instances: a character (letter),  a boolean that indicated whether this
is the end of a word and a HashMap that contains links to other TrieNodes with their character set as dictionary key.
Each TrieNode could have many numbers of children, for up to the total number of alphabets (set for this program). The
HashMap is the main link between root/subroot to its children.

The Trie class contains a dummy root node as its class instance and it has all the following function to operate as a
Trie tree.

insert()
ing elements to the Trie class


doesExist()
This is a function added to help test for the insert() function mentioned above.


search()
traverseTrie()

toChar()
This is a helper function to help switch from integers to alphabets in the code.
